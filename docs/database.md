# Database setup

Full reset and fresh install for Supabase. Run in **SQL Editor** in order.

## Scripts

| Step | File | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | `scripts/reset-database.sql` | Drop all app tables, triggers, functions; delete all `auth.users` |
| 2 | `scripts/setup-database.sql` | Create tables, `updated_at` triggers, RLS, signup profile trigger |

There are no incremental migration files — always reset then setup when schema changes.

## Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `clients` | Company / brand owner (contact only — no social URLs) |
| `team_members` | Internal staff |
| `projects` | Client engagement: social profile URLs, manager, posts |
| `project_team_members` | Extra team on a project (assignment history via `ended_at`) |
| `posts` | Scheduled content (`project_id` FK) |
| `profiles` | Auth user roles + portal `client_id` |

## Relationships

```
auth.users ──1:1── profiles
profiles.client_id ──► clients (portal access)
clients ──1:N── projects
projects.manager_id ──► team_members (required)
projects ──1:N── project_team_members ──► team_members
projects ──1:N── posts
```

## Domain rules

- **Client** — one company; portal users link here via `profiles.client_id`.
- **Project** — belongs to one client; holds `socials` jsonb + required `manager_id`.
- **Post** — belongs to one project; `socials` (platform tags) + `post_links` (published URLs) are per post.
- Same client, different social accounts → create another **project** under that client.
- Posts require a project — no project, no post.

## RLS summary (from setup-database.sql)

| Table | Admin (authenticated) | Portal (client role) |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| `clients` | Full CRUD | SELECT own row (`profiles.client_id`) |
| `team_members` | Full CRUD | — |
| `projects` | Full CRUD | — |
| `project_team_members` | Full CRUD | — |
| `posts` | Full CRUD | SELECT posts for projects under linked client |
| `profiles` | Read/update own; admins update any | Read/update own |

## After setup

1. Sign up a new user in the app (`/auth`).
2. Promote to admin in SQL Editor:

```sql
update public.profiles
set role = 'admin', client_id = null
where id = '<auth-user-uuid>';
```

3. Add team members (at least one with role **manager**).
4. Add clients → projects → posts.
